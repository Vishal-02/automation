i'm trying to automate stuff using python, let's see how it works out

ideas for other tasks i'd like automated:
- manga scraper:
    - a database stores the manga i've read and the latest chapter i've read
    - when i enter the name of a manga, it goes to the website (creator's choice) and checks how many chapters are released
    - say i read till chapter 90 and chapter 100 is out, it then asks if you wanna download the remaining chapters 
    - if yes, downloads in the form of a pdf and updates latest chapter in the database
    - it's basically making an api or something and then using the info from that
    - sometimes i just wanna check if mushoku tensei has a new chapter but i go to the website and end up reading manga for like
      10 hours. can't have that shit happen any more

- anime scraper:
    - can i do something similar to the manga scraper for anime?

- expense tracker:
    - reads messages that come to my mobile from the bank
    - keeps track of how much money has been spent
    - create fields to add a narrative and make it possible to include cash transactions
    - in case it wasn't clear, we're building an app
    - i have no idea how to make apps so this is going to be the most time consuming project yet
    - either link it to sheets or make it be able to export expenses as an excel fields
